A student decides to perform some operations on big words to compress them,
so thet become easy to remember. An operation consists of choosing a group of 
K consecutive equal characters and removing them. The student keeps performing
this operation as long as it is possible. Determine the final word after the 
operation is performed.

Example:
word = "abbcccb";
k = 3

remove k = 3 characters, 'c', -> "abbb";
remove 3 characters 'b', -> "a";


complete the function compressWord, return string: denotes the final word.

public static String compressWord(String word, int k) {

}
