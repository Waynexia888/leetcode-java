A prisoner is planning to escape from prison! The prison's gate consists of 
horizontal and vertical bars that are spaced one unit apart, so the area of 
each hole between the bars is 1 x 1. The prisoner manages to remove certain bars
to make some bigger holes. Determine the area of the largest hole in the gate 
after the bars are removed.

// example:
// n = 6, m = 6, h = [4], v = [2]


// complete the function prison, return int: a long integer denoting the area of 
// the biggest hole in the prison gate's bars.
