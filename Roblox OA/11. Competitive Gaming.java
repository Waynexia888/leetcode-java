A group of friends are playing a video game together. During the game, each 
player earns a number of points. At the end of a round, players who receive at 
least a certain rank get to "level up" their characters to gain increased abilities.
Given the scores of the players at the end of a round, how many players will 
be able to level up?

for example: if there are four players, and three players tie for first place,
their ranks are 1, 1, 1, and 4

example: k = 3; scores = [100, 50, 50, 25]

these players' ranks are [1, 2, 2, 4]. Because the players need to have a rank 
of at leasr 3 to level up. only the first three players qualify. 
Therefore, the answer is 3.
